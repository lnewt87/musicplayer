# musicplayer
This is the code for an MP3 player created in eclipse using a Java GUI. I had to add jars to the library in order for the music to play. The music is loaded into the playlist and can be played, stopped, paused, resumed, go to previous song and go to next song. The program is able to read in the minutes and seconds of the songfile.
